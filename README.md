Documents associated to manuscript 477196 on mass mortality events

We developed R scripts to produce figures for our manuscript
"Ecological effects and ecosystem shifts caused by mass mortality events on early life stages of fish"

Current index (01.07.2019):

* r_script_for_figure2.R  --- R script for creating Figure showing changes in the index of total biomass 
* r_script_for_figure3.R  --- R script for creating Figure showing changes in age structured biomass
* Rscript_Figure5.R       --- R script for creating Figure showing ecological and fisheries indicators 
* Rscript_FigureS2andS3.R --- R script for creating Figure showing changes in nitrogen (structural and residual)

Figure 4 was created using R-script developed by Kelli Johnson, Isaac Kaplan, and Gavin Fay for Olsen et al. (2018). This code has been published:
